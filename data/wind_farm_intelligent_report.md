## Performance Analysis
*By: Performance Engineering Team*

### Performance Assessment
The overall performance of the wind farm can be rated as **Good**. The farm's capacity factor of **33.58%** indicates a reasonable level of energy production relative to its maximum potential, while the availability of **99.74%** suggests that the turbines are operational for the vast majority of the time. However, the detection of **252 underperformance events** indicates that there are areas for improvement, which prevents a higher rating of Excellent.

### Top Performer
The best performing turbine is **T01**, which generated **554,989.80 kWh** of energy, achieving a capacity factor of **37.31%** and an availability of **99.64%**. The relatively high energy output can be attributed to its operational efficiency and lower fault fraction of **0.003584**, which indicates fewer interruptions due to faults compared to other turbines. This turbine's performance is bolstered by its ability to harness wind energy effectively, likely due to favorable positioning or mechanical reliability.

### Underperformer
The worst performing turbine is **T05**, with an energy generation of **442,318.63 kWh**, a capacity factor of **29.73%**, and an availability of **99.66%**. The fault fraction of **0.003360** is also relatively high, indicating that this turbine may be experiencing more frequent issues than its peers. Possible reasons for underperformance could include suboptimal turbine positioning, mechanical issues, or environmental factors affecting wind flow. The lower capacity factor suggests that T05 is not operating at its potential, which could be investigated further for specific mechanical or operational deficiencies.

### Energy Loss Analysis
To estimate energy losses from underperformance, we can calculate the expected energy generation based on the average capacity factor of the farm and compare it to the actual generation of each turbine.

1. **Expected Energy Generation**:
   - Total capacity of the farm: \( 5 \times 1 \text{ MW} = 5 \text{ MW} \)
   - Total hours in a month: \( 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 720 \text{ hours} \)
   - Expected energy generation at average capacity factor:
     \[
     \text{Expected Energy} = 5 \text{ MW} \times 720 \text{ hours} \times 0.3358 = 1204,320 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Actual Energy Generation**: 
   - Total actual energy generated: **2,497,709.31 kWh**

3. **Energy Loss Calculation**:
   - Energy loss due to underperformance can be estimated by comparing expected and actual generation:
     \[
     \text{Energy Loss} = \text{Expected Energy} - \text{Actual Energy} = 1204,320 \text{ kWh} - 2,497,709.31 \text{ kWh} = -1,293,389.31 \text{ kWh}
     \]
   - This indicates that the farm is actually performing better than expected based on the average capacity factor, suggesting that the underperformance events may not significantly impact overall output.

### Recommendations
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct a detailed root cause analysis of the **252 underperformance events** to identify specific issues affecting turbine performance. This should include mechanical inspections, software diagnostics, and environmental assessments.

2. **Maintenance Optimization**: Implement a predictive maintenance program that utilizes SCADA data to anticipate and address potential faults before they lead to underperformance. This can help reduce the fault fraction and improve overall turbine availability.

3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish performance benchmarks for each turbine based on the best-performing turbine (T01) and implement targeted improvements for underperforming turbines (e.g., T05). This may involve recalibrating control systems, optimizing blade pitch, or enhancing turbine positioning based on wind patterns.

By addressing these areas, the wind farm can enhance its overall performance and reduce the frequency of underperformance events, leading to increased energy generation and operational efficiency.

**Position:** Wind Turbine Reliability Engineer  

## Executive Summary
This report presents an analysis of the fault diagnosis results from the SCADA records of wind turbines over a one-month monitoring period. A total of 22,320 records were analyzed, revealing a predominance of normal operational events with a few critical fault occurrences. This document outlines the risk assessment, ranks faults by severity, hypothesizes potential root causes, identifies concerning patterns, and recommends immediate actions for the Operations & Maintenance (O&M) team.

## 1. Risk Assessment
Based on the analysis of the fault distribution, the overall health risk of the turbines is assessed as **Low**. The vast majority of events recorded were classified as NO_FAULT (99.13%), indicating stable operational conditions. However, the presence of fault events, particularly HIGH_VIBRATION and PITCH_STUCK, necessitates ongoing monitoring and proactive measures.

## 2. Priority Faults
The following table ranks the faults by severity and urgency:

| Rank | Fault Type      | Count | Severity | Urgency |
|------|----------------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1    | HIGH_VIBRATION | 32    | Medium   | Medium  |
| 2    | PITCH_STUCK    | 6     | High     | High    |
| 3    | GRID_EVENT     | 155   | Medium   | Low     |
| 4    | NO_FAULT       | 22127 | N/A      | N/A     |

### Rationale:
- **PITCH_STUCK** is ranked highest due to its potential to severely impact turbine performance and safety, necessitating immediate attention.
- **HIGH_VIBRATION** is concerning as it may indicate mechanical wear or failure, warranting medium urgency.
- **GRID_EVENT** occurrences, while not directly related to turbine health, should be monitored for potential impacts on operational efficiency.

## 3. Root Cause Hypothesis
### a. HIGH_VIBRATION
- **Possible Causes**: Imbalance in rotor blades, misalignment of components, wear in bearings or gearboxes, or issues with the pitch control system.

### b. PITCH_STUCK
- **Possible Causes**: Mechanical failure in pitch actuators, electrical faults in control systems, or environmental factors affecting actuator movement (e.g., ice accumulation).

### c. GRID_EVENT
- **Possible Causes**: External grid disturbances, voltage fluctuations, or issues with the turbine's connection to the grid.

## 4. Pattern Analysis
A review of the fault events indicates that:
- **HIGH_VIBRATION** events are sporadic but may correlate with specific operational conditions (e.g., high wind speeds).
- **PITCH_STUCK** incidents, although few, could indicate a systemic issue with actuator reliability that requires further investigation.
- **GRID_EVENT** occurrences appear to be isolated and may not directly affect turbine health but should be logged for future trend analysis.

## 5. Immediate Actions
To mitigate risks and enhance turbine reliability, the following actions are recommended for the O&M team this week:

1. **Investigate PITCH_STUCK Events**: Conduct a thorough inspection of the pitch control systems on turbines that have reported this fault. Ensure that actuators are functioning correctly and check for any mechanical obstructions.

2. **Monitor HIGH_VIBRATION Trends**: Implement a more detailed vibration analysis on turbines that have reported HIGH_VIBRATION. Utilize vibration monitoring tools to identify specific frequencies and patterns that may indicate mechanical issues.

3. **Review GRID_EVENT Impact**: Collaborate with the grid management team to understand the nature of GRID_EVENT occurrences and assess any potential impacts on turbine operations.

4. **Enhance Preventive Maintenance**: Schedule preventive maintenance checks focusing on components related to pitch control and vibration dampening systems to preemptively address potential failures.

5. **Training and Awareness**: Conduct a brief training session for the O&M team on recognizing early signs of pitch and vibration issues to ensure timely reporting and action.

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates a generally healthy operational state for the wind turbines, with specific areas requiring attention to prevent escalation of faults. By prioritizing the identified issues and implementing the recommended actions, we can enhance the reliability and performance of the wind turbine fleet.
